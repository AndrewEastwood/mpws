As you may remember from the front page information, we are an essay writing service that particularly focuses on urgent (less than 24 hours to deadline) and super-urgent orders (less than 12 hours) irrespective of the amount of pages.

<p class="cell03">At times our essay writers get to talk even to the PARENTS of the students who regularly order essays at our writing service:</p>
<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>I was so touched by how personal one could make another one's paper. I cried as I read this essay.....I am the mother. I am sure that my daughter will send you a message too. She told me that you did an amazing job. Unfortunately, I was not able to help her, and her load is 'huge' at this time. Thank you so very much! Wishing you many blessings! ...the Mom.</p>

<p>You are very welcome! If there anything else I could do for you, feel free to ask.</p>
<p class="cell03">Here is a case of how communication between a customer and a writer can help better identify the real purpose of the custom essay to be written:</p>
<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>I loved the paper you wrote, however I guess I wasn't clear enough about what the paper needed to include. The fieldwork experience part was great, still I needed to write about how I have connected children and science through what I have learned in my science education class, for example we've read articles, have done hand's on activities, mood observation, we're reading, &quot;Primary Science,&quot; ets and through our readings I've learned to embrace and not dismiss any of the ideas of children, to avoid getting them discouraged etc. Would it be possible to add on to the paper, this part is crucial to my grade, and If you need more information please feel free to ask me. </p>

<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>The essay seems to answer&quot;What kind of person is Tiberius &quot;instead of &quot;What motivated Tiberius&quot;.Please revise it asap. WH, March, 2012</p>
<p class="cell02">Writer:</p>
<p>Hello again!<br /> Concernig the motivation. You must understand, that the formula of his motivation is not a simple one-variable thing. Even the sources you sent confirm that it cannot be clearly and confidently stated. His formula for motivation consisted of ,as argued in the essay, not just personal charisma, not just altruism, not just patriotism, but all of them together.<br /> As a patriot, he wanted the better future for his country, as an altruist, he wanted the poor have means for living, as a leader,he was ready to go to the extremes to achive his goal. <br />This is what the essay has to answer to the title's question, as could be found in the conclusion &quot;Summing up, one could say that Tiberius Gracchus did not target some sort of personal enrichment or nowhere showed the longing for his own personality cult, but being engulfed with his charismatic</p>
<p>vision to change the destructive order to help the common people, he soon turned into a ready-for-all revolutionary, with the whole of his life put at stake for the implementation of his vision&quot;.<br /> I hope this helps you. Btw, you can use the above ideas as you want.<br /> Hope, we have finally settled it this time.</p>
<p class="cell03">Examples of MIXED Reviews:</p>
<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>Very Good, just a few grammatical error. too much background, however, as it is an analysis of the painting. What is your writer #? I would like to use you for my next paper. </p>
<p class="cell04">JJ, March, 2012</p>
<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>Good control in grammer, and the sentence structure is good enough for college student's level. one of the most important things is that the writer finish it on time. if he finish it late, teachers will not accept the paper anymore. the only thing i don't like is some sentences are copied, not in the writer's own words. </p>
<p class="cell04">BW, March, 2012</p>
<p class="cell02">Writer:</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. There is no copy paste in the work. As its a subject of history, the same names of the events, same dates, names of people,same phrases will recur in writing of different people and make them similar .Likewise, i have provided ample references to the sources from which the materials were taken. And of course, did a fast job of reading and writing on their basis. Thank you again for your quick and substantive feedback!</p>
<p class="cell03">Examples of NEGATIVE Reviews:</p>
<p>As you will understand from the conversation below, a two-way communication while placing an order and during the time when an essay is being written is a major factor in satisfying a customers' need:</p>
<p class="cell02">Customer:</p>
<p>i dont need my paper to be redone. it is already graded and cannot be redone. i gave you the exact grading point system that my instuctor used to grade the paper and i still recieved a 61%. this is unacceptable. i paid $105 for a quality paper to be writen because i needed the good grade. one of your garuntees amongst the many of them is that the paper will be writen by an expert in the field on the subject they are writing about. REALLLY??<br /> Also, you guarntee 100% that the paper will be writen with the specifications that are given. I gave you the EXACT specifications striaght what the instuctor gave me. you had the assignment, the EXACT grading point system that the instructor uses and still my paper is basically an F. Is this truely acceptable for your company? is this what you pride your high standards and guarantees of quality off of? I had planned on having two other papers writen with you, but with this type of work you do im glad that i didnt move forward with that.I live in a very large college district and i intend on spreading the word about your services to all that i can. Also, i demand the 100% money back guarantee that you have plastered all over your websiite immediatly. i will provide you with a copy of the paper that i recieved from your company graded if you need me to. just
 let me know where you would like it sent.</p>
<p class="cell02">Writer:</p>
<p>Dear client!<br /> We are sorry to hear how your professor has scored your paper.We understand your frustration. Let us remind you of &quot;the exact grading point system&quot; that you refer to in you letter.
  &quot;must be unique, one subject being observed. instuctor very strict on formatting and citation. gave me a 0 on last paper because of it. text book used for this class is Discovering The Lifespan(1st edition) Robert Feldman, Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009 ISBN#978-0136-061-670 Use for citing ref.&quot; From this we can extract the following &quot;exact grading point system&quot;:<br /> 1)must have no matches with other works<br />
2)APA format must be adhered<br /> 3)critically important to use the given book<br /> 4)citaions must be provided from the given book.<br />Let us discuss it point by point.<br /> 
1) it is of no difficulty to paste the work in http://www.articlechecker.com, a tool used to check plagiarism and see that it shows &quot;no matches found&quot;.<br />
2) apa format is observed,as the your paper was done in an APA template, freely dowloaded from most athoritative educational websites<br /> 
3)the writer sent you as many as three messages trying to get in contact with you and you replied to none of them. the writer's repsonse was the critical need of the link to the book you specified. the writer spent a lot of time searching the Internet and found no link. Yet, as you did not reply, and the writer trying to help you as best as possible, began to search for indirect mentions of the book in the net and found some. The writer informed you of all the actions taken and you did not respond in any way. Your reasons for not checking your mail is beyond the writer's responsibility.
  The writer showed persistence in attempting to serve the unresponding client in whatever way it was possible, with only opportuntity left as using sites quoting the book indirectly.Yet the quotes were made direct in your paper, as it was demanded so. This takes care of point #4.<br /><br />
No other demands or criteria of the &quot;exact grading point system&quot; were available to the writer (none more concerning the structure or the content)and we should thank the writer for the persistence to serve the client the best way possible. Unfortunatley, you appeared not to respond to all the informed subsequent steps the writer took to help you, seeing the need of your guidance to make work even better.<br /><br /> 
Again, we do share your frustration of the grade you received.Your professor must have his\her educational reasons for that and this must be accepted. At the same time we see that the author tried his best to help you in all ways available.</p>
<p class="cell03">Be sure to communicate your order details clearly and comprehensively!</p>
